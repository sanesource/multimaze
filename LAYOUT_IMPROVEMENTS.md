## Overview

Redesigned the game screen layout to be non-scrollable with better space utilization and a cleaner, more professional appearance.

## Changes Made

### Before ❌

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Header:                             │
│  Timer (left) | Stats (right)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│         Game Canvas                 │
│                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Footer: Player chips (scrollable)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
                ↕️ Scrollable
```

### After ✅

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Unified Header:                     │
│ Timer | Player Chips | Stats        │
│ (left)│   (center)   │ (right)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│                                     │
│         Game Canvas                 │
│        (Full Height)                │
│                                     │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
           🔒 No Scrolling
```

## Layout Structure

### Unified Header (Fixed Top)

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⏰ 4:23  👤👤👤👤  👥 Active: 4  🏆 Finished: 0  │
│   Timer    Players        Stats                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Left Section - Timer

- Large, prominent time display
- Color-coded urgency (green → yellow → red)
- Icon for quick recognition

#### Center Section - Player Chips

- All player status in one row
- Color-coded dots matching game
- Current player highlighted with white ring
- Compact badges (✓ for finished, DC for disconnected)
- Horizontal scroll if many players
- Truncated names with tooltip

#### Right Section - Stats

- Active player count
- Finished player count
- Compact icon-based design

## Technical Details

### Container Changes

```jsx
// Old: Scrollable container
<div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col p-2">

// New: Fixed height, no scroll
<div className="h-screen flex flex-col overflow-hidden">
```

### Canvas Sizing

- Dynamically calculates available space
- Accounts for header height (~100px)
- Accounts for controls height (~50px)
- Accounts for padding (~32px)
- Responsive to window resize
- Caps cell size at 50px for better visuals
- Minimum cell size of 20px

### Responsive Design

```javascript
availableHeight = windowHeight - headerHeight - controlsHeight - padding;
cellSize = min(width / cols, height / rows, maxSize);
```

## UX Improvements

### 1. **No Scrolling** 🎯

- Entire game visible at once
- No need to scroll to see player status
- Professional full-screen experience

### 2. **Better Space Utilization** 📏

- Canvas gets maximum available height
- Header is compact but informative
- No wasted vertical space

### 3. **At-a-Glance Information** 👀

- Timer always visible
- All players visible in header
- Stats immediately accessible
- No context switching needed

### 4. **Cleaner Design** ✨

- Single header bar (not split top/bottom)
- More focused gameplay area
- Less visual clutter
- Better hierarchy

### 5. **Improved Player Identification** 🎨

- Current player scales up (105%) with white ring
- Color dots match in-game avatars
- Compact status badges
- Tooltips for long names

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (Wide Screens)

- All header items in single row
- Players spread across center
- Plenty of space for everyone

### Tablet/Smaller Screens

- Header wraps if needed (flex-wrap)
- Player chips scroll horizontally
- Still no vertical scrolling

### Window Resize

- Canvas automatically resizes
- Maintains aspect ratio
- Cell size recalculates
- Everything stays proportional

## Visual Hierarchy

```
Priority 1: Game Canvas (largest, center)
Priority 2: Timer (left, prominent)
Priority 3: Player Status (center, scannable)
Priority 4: Stats (right, compact)
```

## Player Chip Design

### Components

- **Color Dot**: 2.5px circle matching player color
- **Username**: Truncated at 100px with ellipsis
- **Status Badge**:
  - ✓ = Finished (yellow background)
  - DC = Disconnected (gray background)
- **Highlight Ring**: White ring for current player
- **Scale Effect**: 105% scale for current player

### States

```jsx
Normal Player:     [🔵 Alice         ]
Current Player:    [🔵 Bob        ]← (ring + scale)
Finished:          [🟢 Carol    ✓  ]
Disconnected:      [🔴 Dave     DC ]
```

## Performance
