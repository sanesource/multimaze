# Testing the Animation Improvements

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the application
./start.sh

# Or manually:
cd backend && npm start &
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## What to Look For

### 1. Smooth Movement ‚ú®

- **Before**: Players jumped instantly from cell to cell
- **After**: Players glide smoothly with easing animation
- **Test**: Press arrow keys rapidly - movement should feel fluid

### 2. Directional Arrows üéØ

- **What**: Small white arrow inside each player showing direction
- **Test**: Move in different directions (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí) and watch the arrow rotate
- **Benefit**: Always know which way you or opponents are facing

### 3. Scale/Bounce Effect üé™

- **What**: Players slightly grow when moving, then shrink back
- **Test**: Move once and watch the player "bounce"
- **Timing**: Scale effect lasts ~1 second

### 4. Particle Trails üí´

- **What**: Colored dots trail behind moving players
- **Test**: Move around and watch for colored particles fading away
- **Colors**: Particles match player color (blue, red, green, etc.)

### 5. Visual Feedback üéÆ

- **What**: Arrow key UI elements light up when pressed
- **Location**: Bottom of game screen
- **Test**: Press ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí or WASD and watch keys glow blue

### 6. Animated Door üö™‚ú®

- **What**: Goal is now a detailed wooden door with magical effects
- **Features**:
  - Brown wooden panels with carved details
  - Golden door knob on the right
  - Pulsing golden glow around the door
  - 8 rotating sparkles orbiting the door
  - Glowing border that pulses
- **Test**: Look at the goal - should see a detailed door with magical effects

### 7. Pulsing Effects üåü

- **Door**: Golden glow and sparkles animate continuously
- **Your Player**: White dashed ring rotates around you
- **Test**: Watch the door glow and sparkles rotate smoothly

## Testing Checklist

### Solo Testing

- [ ] Movement feels smooth, not jumpy
- [ ] Arrow keys highlight when pressed
- [ ] Player has directional arrow
- [ ] Particles appear when moving
- [ ] Your player has animated ring
- [ ] Goal door looks detailed with sparkles
- [ ] Door glow and sparkles animate
- [ ] Can use both arrow keys and WASD

### Multiplayer Testing (2+ players)

- [ ] All players animate smoothly
- [ ] Can distinguish yourself from others (white ring)
- [ ] Each player has direction arrow
- [ ] Particles match player colors
- [ ] Can see all players moving in real-time
- [ ] No lag or stutter with 4+ players

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Game runs at smooth 60 FPS
- [ ] No stuttering during rapid movement
- [ ] Works on easy (15√ó15) mazes
- [ ] Works on hard (35√ó35) mazes
- [ ] Browser doesn't slow down over time

## Known Behaviors

### Expected

- Movement has ~0.2s animation time (feels instant but smooth)
- Particles disappear after ~1-2 seconds
- Maximum ~100 particles on screen at once
- Arrow direction updates instantly
- Scale effect returns to normal in ~1 second

### Browser Performance

- **Chrome/Edge**: Optimal performance
- **Firefox**: Excellent performance
- **Safari**: Good performance
- **Mobile**: Reduced particle count may help

## Troubleshooting

### Movement feels laggy

- Check network connection (socket latency)
- Server may be slow to respond
- Animation is client-side, so lag = server issue

### Particles not showing

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure canvas is rendering
- Try refreshing the page

### Keys not highlighting

- Ensure you're focused on game (click canvas)
- Check browser console
- Try clicking inside the game area

## Comparison Video Script

### Before (Original)

1. Start game
2. Press arrow key
3. Player jumps instantly to new cell
4. No visual feedback
5. Hard to follow rapid movement

### After (Improved)

1. Start game
2. Press arrow key - lights up at bottom
3. Player smoothly glides to new cell
4. Directional arrow shows facing direction
5. Particles trail behind
6. Player scales up slightly (bounce effect)
7. Easy to track movement

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics

- **FPS**: 60
- **Frame time**: ~16ms
- **Particle update**: <1ms
- **Player render**: <2ms per player
- **Total render**: <10ms for 8 players + 100 particles

### Monitor Performance

```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
let fps = 0;
let lastTime = performance.now();
function checkFPS() {
  const now = performance.now();
  fps = Math.round(1000 / (now - lastTime));
  console.log("FPS:", fps);
  lastTime = now;
  requestAnimationFrame(checkFPS);
}
checkFPS();
```
