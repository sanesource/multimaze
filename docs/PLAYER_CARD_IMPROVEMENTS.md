# Player Card Style Improvements 🎨

## Overview

Enhanced the player card design in the header to be more visually appealing while hiding the scrollbar for a cleaner look.

## Changes Made

### Scrollbar Fix ✨

#### Problem

- Horizontal scrollbar was visible when many players were present
- Made the header look cluttered and unprofessional

#### Solution

Added custom `scrollbar-hide` utility class:

```css
.scrollbar-hide {
  -ms-overflow-style: none; /* IE and Edge */
  scrollbar-width: none; /* Firefox */
}

.scrollbar-hide::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none; /* Chrome, Safari and Opera */
}
```

**Result**: Scrollbar is hidden but scrolling still works! 🎉

### Player Card Design Improvements

#### Before ❌

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ • Alice          │  (Simple, flat design)
└──────────────────┘
```

#### After ✅

```
┌──────────────────┐
│ ◉ Alice      ✓   │  (Gradient dot, better spacing, styled badges)
└──────────────────┘
```

## Visual Enhancements

### 1. **Gradient Color Dots** 🎨

- **Before**: Solid color circles
- **After**: Gradient from lighter to darker shade
- Added shadow for depth
- Increased size: 2.5px → 3px

```jsx
// Before
"bg-blue-500";

"bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-400 to-blue-600";
```

## Color Gradients

All player dots now use gradients for a more polished look:

| Player | Gradient                                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 1st    | Blue: `from-blue-400 to-blue-600`       |
| 2nd    | Red: `from-red-400 to-red-600`          |
| 3rd    | Green: `from-green-400 to-green-600`    |
| 4th    | Purple: `from-purple-400 to-purple-600` |
| 5th    | Orange: `from-orange-400 to-orange-600` |
| 6th    | Pink: `from-pink-400 to-pink-600`       |
| 7th    | Cyan: `from-cyan-400 to-cyan-600`       |

## Technical Implementation

### Scrollbar Hide

```jsx
<div className="... scrollbar-hide">{/* Player cards */}</div>
```

```jsx
<div className={`w-3 h-3 rounded-full ${color} shadow-md`} />
```

### Current Player Highlight

```jsx
className={`... ${
  isCurrentPlayer
    ? 'bg-white/20 border-white/40 shadow-lg shadow-white/20 scale-105'
    : 'bg-white/5 border-white/10 hover:bg-white/10'
}`}
```

### Circular Badges

```jsx
// Finished
<span className="flex items-center justify-center w-5 h-5 text-xs bg-yellow-500/40 text-yellow-200 rounded-full border border-yellow-400/50">
  ✓
</span>

// Disconnected

  ⚠
</span>
```
