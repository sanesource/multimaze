# Mobile Responsive Update

## Overview

The MultiMaze game has been updated to be fully responsive and playable on mobile devices. This update includes touch controls for mobile gameplay and responsive layouts across all screens.

## Changes Made

### 1. Game Component (`Game.jsx`)

- **Team Results**: Team mode results stack vertically on mobile
- **Responsive Buttons**: Action buttons stack vertically on small screens
- **Smaller Fonts**: Adjusted font sizes throughout for better mobile readability

### 5. HTML Configuration (`index.html`)

- **Enhanced Viewport**: Added `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover` to prevent pinch-zoom and support notched devices
- **Theme Colors**: Added theme-color meta tags for Android, iOS, and Windows to match app design (#0f172a)
- **PWA Manifest**: Created manifest.json for Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Mobile Web App**: Added meta tags for mobile web app capabilities

- **Status Bar**: Set black-translucent status bar style for iOS with matching theme color
- **Safe Areas**: Added viewport-fit=cover to properly handle notched devices (iPhone X+)

### 6. CSS Updates (`index.css`)

- **Global Text Selection Prevention**: Disabled text selection across entire app to prevent accidental highlighting when holding buttons
- **Input Fields Exception**: Re-enabled text selection for input and textarea fields
- **Theme Color Background**: Set HTML background to #0f172a to match theme-color meta tag
- **Safe Area Support**: Added padding for notched devices (iPhone X+) using env(safe-area-inset-\*)
- **Momentum Scrolling**: Added iOS-specific smooth scrolling
- **Overscroll Prevention**: Prevented pull-to-refresh behavior on mobile
- **Fill Available Height**: Used -webkit-fill-available for better iOS viewport handling

## Key Features

### Mobile Touch Controls

- **D-pad Layout**: Intuitive directional control layout with up/down/left/right buttons
- **Auto-Run Feature**: Hold any direction button to continuously move in that direction (150ms intervals)
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons highlight when pressed and held, matching keyboard behavior
- **No Text Selection**: Entire app prevents text selection to avoid blue highlights when holding buttons
- **Touch Prevention**: Canvas and controls prevent accidental selection/zoom
- **Lightning Support**: Dedicated button for lightning power-up in tunnel mode
- **Smart Touch Handling**: Properly handles touch end and touch cancel events for reliable control

### Responsive Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 768px (stacked layouts, touch controls)
- Desktop: ≥ 768px (standard layouts, keyboard controls)
- Uses Tailwind's `md:` prefix for responsive classes

### Mobile-Specific Optimizations

- Smaller cell sizes to fit mazes on mobile screens
- Reduced header/control spacing for more gameplay area
- Hidden player list on mobile during gameplay (shown in header stats)
- Compact font sizes and icon sizes throughout
- Touch-optimized button sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)

## Testing Recommendations

### Mobile Devices to Test

1. **iPhone** (iOS Safari, Chrome)
2. **Android Phones** (Chrome, Samsung Internet)
3. **iPad/Tablets** (should use desktop layout on larger screens)

### Test Scenarios

1. ✅ Create room on mobile
2. ✅ Join room on mobile
3. ✅ Play game with touch controls
4. ✅ Use lightning power-up with touch button
5. ✅ View results screen on mobile
6. ✅ Navigate between all screens
7. ✅ Portrait and landscape orientations
8. ✅ Multiple mobile screen sizes

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome Mobile: ✅ Fully supported
- Safari iOS: ✅ Fully supported
- Samsung Internet: ✅ Fully supported
- Firefox Mobile: ✅ Fully supported
- Opera Mobile: ✅ Fully supported

## Known Limitations

1. Very small screens (<320px width) may have cramped layouts
2. Landscape mode on small phones may have limited vertical space
3. Keyboard controls remain available on mobile devices with keyboards

## Recent Enhancements

### Auto-Run Feature (Added)

- **Hold to Move**: Players can now hold down any direction button to continuously move
- **Immediate Response**: First move happens instantly, then repeats every 150ms
- **Better UX**: No need to tap repeatedly for each move step
- **Mobile-Only**: This feature is specifically for mobile devices to improve touch control experience

## Future Enhancements

- Swipe gestures as an alternative to button controls
- Haptic feedback for button presses (on supported devices)
- Orientation lock to landscape for better gameplay
- Mobile-specific maze sizes (smaller, faster games)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for installable app
- Adjustable auto-run speed setting

## Implementation Details

### Mobile Detection Logic

```javascript
const checkMobile = () => {
  const mobile =
    /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(
      navigator.userAgent
    ) || window.innerWidth < 768;
  setIsMobile(mobile);
};
```

### Touch Control Handler (with Auto-Run)

```javascript
const startMobileMove = (direction) => {
  // Clear any existing interval
  if (moveIntervalRef.current) {
    clearInterval(moveIntervalRef.current);
  }

  // Set the direction and visual feedback
  moveDirectionRef.current = direction;
  setActiveKeys((prev) => new Set(prev).add(direction));

  // Move immediately
  movePlayer(direction);

  // Set up continuous movement (move every 150ms while held)
  moveIntervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
    if (moveDirectionRef.current === direction) {
      movePlayer(direction);
    }
  }, 150);
};

const stopMobileMove = (direction) => {
  // Clear the interval
  if (moveIntervalRef.current) {
    clearInterval(moveIntervalRef.current);
    moveIntervalRef.current = null;
  }

  // Clear the direction
  if (moveDirectionRef.current === direction) {
    moveDirectionRef.current = null;
  }

  // Remove visual feedback
  setActiveKeys((prev) => {
    const newSet = new Set(prev);
    newSet.delete(direction);
    return newSet;
  });
};
```

### Cell Size Calculation (Mobile-Aware)

```javascript
const maxSize = isMobile ? 40 : 50;
const minSize = isMobile ? 12 : 20;
const size = Math.max(Math.min(cellWidth, cellHeight, maxSize), minSize);
```

## Deployment Notes

- No backend changes required
- All changes are frontend-only
- No new dependencies added
- Fully backward compatible with desktop experience
- Mobile optimizations activate automatically based on device detection
