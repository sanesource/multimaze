# Team Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a full team-based game mode for MultiMaze where players can join Team A or Team B, share checkpoint progress, and compete as teams.

## Quick Summary
Team Mode is a multiplayer game mode where:
- Players select Team A (Blue) or Team B (Red) in the lobby
- Teams share checkpoint progress (any team member can collect checkpoints for the team)
- The first team to have ALL members finish wins
- Checkpoint count is dynamically set to max(Team A size, Team B size)
- Team colors are consistent across all screens (Lobby, Game, Results)
- All validation ensures both teams have players and all players have selected a team before game starts

## What Changed
- **11 Files Modified**: 5 backend files, 6 frontend files
- **New Socket Events**: `select-team`, `team-checkpoint-reached`, `team-victory`
- **New Backend Methods**: 9 team-related helper methods in Room model, team results calculation
- **New Frontend Features**: Team selection UI, team-colored players, team victory screen
- **Dynamic Checkpoints**: Maze generator now supports variable checkpoint counts based on team sizes

## Features Implemented

- Color-coded teams (Blue for A, Red for B, Gray for unassigned)
- "Join Team A" / "Join Team B" buttons for unassigned players
- "Switch Team" button for assigned players
- Shows team counts and ready status
- Host cannot start until all players select teams

  - Checkpoints turn green when team reaches them
  - Next checkpoint highlights for your team
- **Team Tracking**: All team members see same checkpoint status

#### Results Component

- **Victory Banner**: Shows winning team (Team A or Team B) with team-colored gradient
- **Side-by-side Team Rankings**:
  - Team A on left (blue theme)
  - Team B on right (red theme)
  - Trophy icon for winning team
  - Individual player rankings within each team
  - Completion times and moves per player
- **Team Statistics**:
  - Total players per team
  - Finished count
  - Fastest time per team
  - Checkpoints reached

## Key Mechanics

### Team Selection
1. Players join lobby and see team selection UI with three sections:
   - Team A (blue theme) - shows all players who selected Team A
   - Team B (red theme) - shows all players who selected Team B
   - Unassigned (gray theme) - shows players who haven't selected a team yet
2. Players can freely switch between teams using "Join Team A/B" or "Switch Team" buttons
3. Host cannot start until:
   - All players pick a team (no unassigned players)
   - Both teams have at least one player
   - All players are ready
4. Teams can be unbalanced (e.g., 3 vs 2)
5. Ready status is independent of team selection

### Checkpoint System
- Checkpoint count = max(Team A size, Team B size)
- Checkpoints are shared across team - any team member can reach them
- All checkpoints must be collected before team can finish
- Team members can split up strategically

### Win Condition
- First team to have ALL members reach the endpoint wins
- Team must have collected all checkpoints first
- Individual member finishing doesn't win - entire team must finish

### Gameplay Flow
1. Create room with team mode enabled
2. Players join and select teams
3. Host starts game (checkpoints auto-enabled, count = max team size)
4. Teams race to collect checkpoints and reach endpoint
5. First team with all members finishing wins
6. Results show team victory and individual rankings

## Socket Events

### New Events
- **Client ‚Üí Server**: `select-team` with `{ team: 'A' | 'B' }`
- **Server ‚Üí Client**: `team-checkpoint-reached` with team, order, player info
- **Server ‚Üí Client**: `team-victory` with winning team

- **Team sections**: Blue/Red borders with matching background tints
- **Player cards**: Blue/Red backgrounds with matching borders

### Game Screen
- **Player circles**: Blue (#3b82f6) for Team A, Red (#ef4444) for Team B
- **Team checkpoint indicators**: Shared progress shown for all team members

### Results Screen
- **Victory banner**: Blue gradient (blue-400 to blue-600) or Red gradient (red-400 to red-600)
- **Team sections**: Matching blue/red borders and backgrounds
- **Trophy icon**: Shown for winning team

## Validation and Safety Checks

### Start Game Validation
1. All players must be ready
2. In team mode:
   - All players must have selected a team
   - Both Team A and Team B must have at least one player
   - Checkpoint count automatically set to max(Team A size, Team B size)
   - Checkpoints automatically enabled (forced)

### Team Selection Validation
- Can only select teams in waiting/lobby state
- Team must be 'A' or 'B'
- Players can freely switch until game starts

### Finish Validation
- Team mode: Team must have all checkpoints before any member can finish
- Individual mode: Player must have all checkpoints before finishing
